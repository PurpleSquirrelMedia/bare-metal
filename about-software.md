CentOS 8, Debian 10, and RHEL 8 and 9 don't support "Add on" software configurations. These operating systems also don't support the **Provision script** and **User data** selections for server configuration options. If you're migrating from a server that has "Add on" software configurations, you can choose to migrate to an earlier version.
